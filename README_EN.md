## Installation and Usage

### Installation

```bash
pip install ruyiPage --upgrade
```

If this is your first installation, the command above also works as the default way to install the latest version.

If you run the project from source, or distribute the source tree to students, install the project dependencies as well:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the installed version after installation:

```bash
python -c "import ruyipage; print(ruyipage.__version__)"
```

### Simplest launch

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxPage

page = FirefoxPage()
page.get("https://www.example.com")
print(page.title)
page.quit()
```

### Specify Firefox path and userdir

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxOptions, FirefoxPage

opts = FirefoxOptions()
opts.set_browser_path(r"D:\Firefox\firefox.exe")
opts.set_user_dir(r"D:\ruyipage_userdir")

page = FirefoxPage(opts)
page.get("https://www.example.com")
print(page.title)
page.quit()
```

### Beginner-friendly `launch`

```python
from ruyipage import launch

page = launch(
    browser_path=r"D:\Firefox\firefox.exe",
    user_dir=r"D:\ruyipage_userdir",
    headless=False,
    port=9222,
)

page.get("https://www.example.com")
print(page.title)
page.quit()
```

### Attach to an Already-Open Browser

If Firefox is already open manually, or a fingerprint browser is started first, `ruyiPage` can attach to the existing instance directly.

This flow works for any **Firefox-kernel fingerprint browser**, including products such as ADS / FlowerBrowser.
If the browser lets you set a fixed startup argument, it is recommended to add:

```text
--remote-debugging-port=9222
```

If the browser backend rewrites it to a random port, you can still use process-based automatic discovery.

```python
from ruyipage import auto_attach_exist_browser_by_process

page = auto_attach_exist_browser_by_process(
    latest_tab=True,
)

print(page.browser.address)
print(page.title)
print(page.url)
```

Useful when:

- you want to open Firefox manually first and let `ruyiPage` take over afterward
- you want to launch a fingerprint browser first and connect from your business script later
- you are using ADS / FlowerBrowser and the real debugging port changes every run
- you do not want to maintain a port range manually and prefer process-feature-based discovery

### What `browser_path` and `user_dir` Mean

#### `browser_path`

The path to the Firefox executable.

Use it when:

- Firefox is not installed in the default location
- you have multiple Firefox versions
- you are using a portable Firefox build

#### `user_dir`

This is the Firefox profile / user directory.

Use it when:

- you want to reuse login state
- you want to keep cookies / local storage
- you want to reuse extensions, certificates, or preferences

If you do not set it:

- `ruyiPage` will create a temporary profile automatically
- this is suitable for one-off testing
- it is usually cleaned up after closing

## Project Positioning

`ruyiPage` is a Python library focused on **Firefox browser automation**. Its underlying protocol comes from:

- WebDriver BiDi: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/

If you are not looking for just another CDP-based automation library, but instead care about:

- **A next-generation Firefox automation framework**
- **BiDi rather than CDP**
- **Native actions that preserve a large amount of `isTrusted` behavior**
- **Built-in human-like interaction capability for high-risk pages**
- **Support for interception, mocking, collectors, and network control**
- **Support for different user contexts in one browser, isolating cookies and storage across tabs**
- **A Firefox automation stack that is easier to maintain long-term**

then `ruyiPage` is built for that direction.

You can think of it as:

> A high-level automation framework for **Firefox**, with **WebDriver BiDi as the foundation** and beginner-friendly APIs on top.

It especially emphasizes four things:

- **No CDP dependency**, which naturally avoids the CDP exposure surface
- **Native action chains first**, to keep input, drag, click, and similar behavior closer to real `isTrusted` browser interaction
- **Built-in human-like interaction support**, better suited to high-risk pages
- **Built-in user context isolation**, suitable for multi-account and multi-session flows in one browser
- **High-level APIs that are easy to get started with**, which also helps teams keep a consistent code style

---

## About Firefox Kernel and Fingerprint Browsers

If your target site is highly sensitive to automation, it is better to start from the browser-level solution directly.

### Recommended Approach

The Firefox kernel solution provided by this project is the recommended first choice.

At the same time, `ruyiPage` can also work with any Firefox fingerprint browser.

For example:

- https://github.com/LoseNine/firefox-fingerprintBrowser

The value of this kind of browser/kernel is:

- it customizes Firefox from the lower browser layer
- it is not just front-end level masking
- it works better together with `ruyiPage` on stronger anti-bot sites

### Conclusion

The role of `ruyiPage` is:

- to provide high-level Firefox + BiDi automation capabilities
- to avoid the CDP detection surface

But if you are visiting high-risk sites, it is still recommended to:

1. use the Firefox kernel solution recommended by this project first
2. then use `ruyiPage` to automate it

That combination is generally more stable.

---

## Why Firefox + BiDi

Many automation frameworks rely heavily on CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

`ruyiPage` takes a different path:

- using **Firefox** as the core browser
- using **WebDriver BiDi** as the core protocol
- avoiding CDP entirely

That means:

- no traditional CDP automation exposure surface
- closer alignment with the W3C next-generation browser automation direction
- a better fit for Firefox-focused automation, input simulation, event listening, and network control

---

## How It Compares to Other Frameworks

The table below is not about declaring one framework absolutely better than another. It highlights a few points people usually care about most:

- which browser direction each framework mainly focuses on
- whether it depends on CDP
- how strong the CDP exposure surface is
- how good Firefox / BiDi support is
- how likely it is to be targeted by detection

| Framework | Main browser direction | Underlying protocol | CDP exposure surface | Firefox / BiDi support | Targeted detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ruyiPage` | **Firefox** | **WebDriver BiDi** | **No CDP exposure surface** | **High**, Firefox + BiDi is the main route | **Low**, native BiDi + `isTrusted` behavior + human-like actions fit high-risk scenarios better; even more stable with the Firefox kernel solution recommended by this project or any Firefox fingerprint browser |
| Playwright | Chromium / Firefox / WebKit | Proprietary protocol, many features still lean toward Chromium | Medium to high | Medium, supports Firefox but is not primarily designed around Firefox BiDi | Medium to high, many sites target mainstream automation fingerprints first |
| Selenium | Multiple browsers | WebDriver Classic + partial BiDi | Low to medium | Medium, broad compatibility but weaker high-level BiDi capabilities | Medium, traditional automation traits are widespread |
| Puppeteer | Chromium | CDP | **High** | Low, not really focused on Firefox | **High**, CDP-based exposure is more obvious and more frequently targeted |
| DrissionPage | Chromium | Hybrid driver approach, still mainly Chromium-oriented | Medium to high | Low, Firefox is not the main focus | Medium to high, still easier to fall into mainstream Chromium detection paths |

### One-Line Recommendation

- If you mainly do **Firefox automation**: prefer `ruyiPage`
- If you need **unified multi-browser automation**: prefer Playwright / Selenium
- If you mainly work with **Chromium/CDP**: prefer Puppeteer / Playwright
- If you want **Firefox + no CDP dependency + high-level BiDi APIs**: `ruyiPage` is the more relevant option

## Root-Level Quick Start Examples

### 1. Bing Search Example

File: `quickstart_bing_search.py`

It will:

- open Bing
- type a keyword
- press Enter to search
- scrape the first 3 result pages
- print title, URL, and summary

Core pattern:

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxOptions, FirefoxPage, Keys

opts = FirefoxOptions()
page = FirefoxPage(opts)

page.get("https://cn.bing.com/")
page.ele("#sb_form_q").input("小肩膀教育")
page.actions.press(Keys.ENTER).perform()

for item in page.eles("css:#b_results > li.b_algo"):
    title_ele = item.ele("css:h2 a")
    title = title_ele.text
    url = title_ele.attr("href")
```

### 2. Cloudflare / Copilot Example

File: `quickstart_cloudfare.py`

It will:

- open Copilot
- try to find the input box and send a prompt
- attempt to handle Cloudflare automatically
- print full cookies at the end

This example is especially useful for understanding:

- `page.handle_cloudflare_challenge()`
- `page.get_cookies(all_info=True)`
- how `FirefoxOptions` is written into a beginner-level script

### 3. Fingerprint Browser Example

File: `quickstart_fingerprint_browser.py`

It will:

- launch a Firefox fingerprint browser
- load the fingerprint file through `--fpfile=...`
- open `browserscan` to inspect fingerprint results
- combine geolocation, timezone, locale, request headers, and screen size emulation

Core pattern:

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxOptions, FirefoxPage

opts = FirefoxOptions()
opts.set_browser_path(r"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe")
opts.set_fpfile(r"C:\fingerprints\profile1.txt")

page = FirefoxPage(opts)
page.get("https://www.browserscan.net/zh")

page.emulation.set_geolocation(39.9042, 116.4074, accuracy=100)
page.emulation.set_timezone("Asia/Tokyo")
page.emulation.set_locale(["ja-JP", "ja"])
page.network.set_extra_headers({
    "Accept-Language": "ja-JP,ja;q=0.9"
})
page.emulation.set_screen_size(1366, 768, device_pixel_ratio=2.0)
page.refresh()
```

Suitable for:

- combining a Firefox fingerprint browser with `ruyiPage`
- passing fingerprint files, locale, headers, and screen parameters together
- directly validating fingerprint output on sites such as `browserscan`

### 4. Attach to an Already-Open Firefox Fingerprint Browser

File: `examples/39_attach_exist_browser.py`

It will:

- remind you to start Firefox or a Firefox fingerprint browser manually first
- automatically detect and attach based on Firefox / ADS / FlowerBrowser process features
- operate the live browser instance directly after takeover

Core pattern:

```python
from ruyipage import auto_attach_exist_browser_by_process

page = auto_attach_exist_browser_by_process(
    latest_tab=True,
)

print(page.browser.address)
print(page.title)
print(page.url)
```

Suitable for:

- an already-open ADS / FlowerBrowser style Firefox fingerprint browser
- browser backends that rewrite `--remote-debugging-port=9222` to a random port
- automatically discovering the real port from process features and attaching to the running instance

### 5. HTTP Proxy Auth Example

If you are using this project's own Firefox kernel, the kernel already supports reading HTTP proxy credentials from `fpfile` automatically.

That means the business-layer code only needs:

- `opts.set_proxy("http://host:port")`
- `opts.set_fpfile("...")`

When the `fpfile` contains the following fields, the kernel will handle HTTP proxy authentication internally without any extra auth API call:

```text
httpauth.username:your-proxy-username
httpauth.password:your-proxy-password
```

Full example: `examples/38_proxy_auth_ipinfo.py`

Core pattern:

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxOptions, FirefoxPage

opts = FirefoxOptions()
opts.set_proxy("http://your-proxy-host:8080")
opts.set_fpfile(r"C:\path\to\your\profile1.txt")

page = FirefoxPage(opts)
page.get("http://ipinfo.io/json")
```

Suitable for:

- using your own Firefox kernel with `fpfile`-driven HTTP proxy auth
- keeping business-layer proxy setup minimal
- keeping proxy usernames and passwords inside `fpfile` instead of hardcoding them in scripts

---

## Most Common API Guide

This is not a raw list of low-level BiDi commands. It focuses on the **high-level APIs most commonly used by beginners**.

Suggested reading order:

1. Start with `FirefoxPage`
   This is the core page object and almost all operations begin there.
2. Then read `ele()` / `eles()`
   Element lookup is one of the most fundamental capabilities.
3. Then read `actions / downloads / network / events`
   These are the most common advanced extensions in automation work.

Documentation style notes:

- this section prioritizes the **most useful and practical** high-level interfaces
- it does not dump raw BiDi commands and ask beginners to assemble parameters themselves
- each capability tries to explain:
  what it does,
  when to use it,
  the most common calling pattern,
  and what you can continue doing with the return value

---

## 1. Page Object: `FirefoxPage`

### Create a page

```python
from ruyipage import FirefoxPage, FirefoxOptions

page = FirefoxPage()

opts = FirefoxOptions()
page = FirefoxPage(opts)
```

### Common properties

| API | Description | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page.title` | Current page title | `str` |
| `page.url` | Current page URL | `str` |
| `page.html` | Current page HTML | `str` |
| `page.tab_id` | Current tab browsingContext ID | `str` |
| `page.cookies` | Visible cookies on the current page | `list[CookieInfo]` |

### Common navigation

```python
page.get("https://www.example.com")
page.refresh()
page.back()
page.forward()
page.quit()
```

#### `page.get(url, wait='complete')`

Open a page.

```python
page.get("https://www.example.com")
page.get("https://www.example.com", wait="interactive")
```

Parameter notes:

- `url`
  - the target address to visit
  - common values: `https://...`, `file:///...`, `data:text/html,...`
- `wait`
  - page waiting strategy
  - common values:
    - `complete`: wait until the page fully loads
    - `interactive`: wait until `DOMContentLoaded`
    - `none`: return immediately after navigation is issued

Suitable use cases:

- routine navigation: use the default `complete`
- slow page but you only want the DOM first: use `interactive`
- you will listen for events or wait manually later: use `none`

#### `page.back()` / `page.forward()` / `page.refresh()`

These are used for:

- back
- forward
- refresh

```python
page.back()
page.forward()
page.refresh()
```

If you need to verify navigation events, use them together with `page.navigation`.

---

## 2. Element Lookup: `ele()` / `eles()`

### `page.ele(locator)`

Find a single element.

Most common patterns:

```python
page.ele("#kw")
page.ele("css:.item")
page.ele("css:div.card > a")
page.ele("xpath://button[text()='登录']")
page.ele("tag:input")
page.ele("text:登录")
```

Recommended priority for beginners:

1. `#id`
2. `css:...`
3. `xpath:...`

### `page.eles(locator)`

Find all matching elements.

```python
items = page.eles("css:.card")
rows = page.eles("css:table tbody tr")
links = page.eles("tag:a")
```

### Continue searching inside an element

```python
card = page.ele("css:.card")
title = card.ele("css:h2 a")
desc = card.ele("css:.desc")
```

### Common element APIs

| API | Description | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ele.text` | Element text | `str` |
| `ele.html` | Element HTML | `str` |
| `ele.attr(name)` | Read an attribute | `str | None` |
| `ele.click_self()` | Click the element itself | `self` |
| `ele.input(text)` | Type into an input | `self` |
| `ele.clear()` | Clear input content | `self` |

#### `ele.click_self()`

Click the element directly.

```python
page.ele("text:登录").click_self()
```

This is the most recommended click method for beginners.

#### `ele.input(text, clear=True)`

Type content into an input.

```python
page.ele("#kw").input("ruyiPage")
page.ele("#kw").input("ruyiPage", clear=True)
```

Suitable for:

- text input
- search boxes
- file upload inputs

If the element is `<input type="file">`, you can pass a file path directly:

```python
page.ele("#upload").input(r"D:\test.txt")
page.ele("#upload").input([r"D:\1.txt", r"D:\2.txt"])
```

---

## 3. Action Chains: `page.actions`

Used for native BiDi input actions.

```python
page.actions.press(Keys.ENTER).perform()
page.actions.move_to(page.ele("#btn")).click().perform()
page.actions.drag(page.ele("#a"), page.ele("#b")).perform()
page.actions.release()
```

Common uses:

- keyboard input
- mouse clicks
- drag and drop
- wheel scrolling
- human-like movement and clicking

### Common patterns

#### Press Enter

```python
from ruyipage import Keys

page.actions.press(Keys.ENTER).perform()
```

#### Click an element

```python
page.actions.move_to(page.ele("#btn")).click().perform()
```

#### Drag and drop

```python
page.actions.drag(page.ele("#source"), page.ele("#target")).perform()
page.actions.release()
```

### Why `page.actions` is recommended

Because this chain is closer to the native BiDi input model, and many resulting events behave more like real browser input.

---

## 4. Cookies

### Get cookies

```python
cookies = page.get_cookies()
for cookie in cookies:
    print(cookie.name, cookie.value)
```

The returned objects are usually `CookieInfo`. Common fields include:

- `cookie.name`
- `cookie.value`
- `cookie.domain`
- `cookie.path`
- `cookie.http_only`
- `cookie.secure`
- `cookie.same_site`
- `cookie.expiry`

### Filter cookies

```python
cookies = page.get_cookies_filtered(name="session_id", all_info=True)
```

### Set cookies

```python
page.set_cookies({
    "name": "token",
    "value": "abc",
    "domain": "127.0.0.1",
    "path": "/",
})
```

You can also pass multiple cookies at once:

```python
page.set_cookies([
    {"name": "a", "value": "1", "domain": "127.0.0.1", "path": "/"},
    {"name": "b", "value": "2", "domain": "127.0.0.1", "path": "/"},
])
```

### Delete cookies

```python
page.delete_cookies(name="token")
page.delete_cookies()
```

---

## 5. Downloads

High-level entry: `page.downloads`

```python
page.downloads.set_behavior("allow", path=r"D:\downloads")
page.downloads.start()

page.ele("#download").click_self()

event = page.downloads.wait("browsingContext.downloadEnd", timeout=5)
print(event.status)
```

Common methods:

- `set_behavior()`
- `set_path()`
- `start()`
- `stop()`
- `wait()`
- `wait_chain()`
- `wait_file()`

### Typical download flow

```python
page.downloads.set_behavior("allow", path=r"D:\downloads")
page.downloads.start()

page.ele("#download").click_self()

begin = page.downloads.wait("browsingContext.downloadWillBegin", timeout=5)
end = page.downloads.wait("browsingContext.downloadEnd", timeout=5)

print(begin.suggested_filename)
print(end.status)
```

---

## 6. Navigation Events

High-level entry: `page.navigation`

```python
page.navigation.start()
page.get("https://www.example.com")

event = page.navigation.wait("browsingContext.load", timeout=5)
print(event.url)

page.navigation.stop()
```

Suitable for verifying:

- `navigationStarted`
- `domContentLoaded`
- `load`
- `historyUpdated`
- `navigationCommitted`

---

## 7. Generic Event Listening

High-level entry: `page.events`

```python
page.events.start(["network.beforeRequestSent"], contexts=[page.tab_id])
event = page.events.wait("network.beforeRequestSent", timeout=5)
page.events.stop()
```

Suitable for handling:

- `browsingContext.*`
- `network.*`
- `script.*`
- `input.*`
- `log.*`

Return type: `BidiEvent`

Common fields:

- `method`
- `context`
- `url`
- `request`
- `response`
- `error_text`
- `channel`
- `data`
- `multiple`
- `message`

### When to use `page.events`

When you want to listen to protocol-level events directly rather than only caring about the final page state, this is the right tool.

For example:

- listen for `network.beforeRequestSent`
- listen for `browsingContext.contextCreated`
- listen for `script.message`
- listen for `input.fileDialogOpened`

---

## 8. Network Capabilities

High-level entry: `page.network`

### Set extra headers

```python
page.network.set_extra_headers({"X-Test": "yes"})
```

This is commonly used to:

- add testing headers to requests
- mark environments
- verify whether headers are actually sent together with interception

### Set cache behavior

```python
page.network.set_cache_behavior("bypass")
```

Where:

- `default`: browser default caching policy; a cache hit may avoid a real request
- `bypass`: try to bypass cache and force a real request

### Data Collector

```python
collector = page.network.add_data_collector(
    ["responseCompleted"],
    data_types=["response"],
)

data = collector.get(request_id, data_type="response")
collector.disown(request_id, data_type="response")
collector.remove()
```

Where:

## 9. Browsing Contexts

High-level entry: `page.contexts`

```python
tree = page.contexts.get_tree()
print(len(tree.contexts))

tab_id = page.contexts.create_tab()
page.contexts.close(tab_id)

page.contexts.reload()
page.contexts.set_viewport(800, 600)
```

Common methods:

- `get_tree()`
- `create_tab()`
- `create_window()`
- `close()`
- `reload()`
- `set_viewport()`
- `set_bypass_csp()`

### `tree = page.contexts.get_tree()`

The returned value is not a raw dict but a high-level result object.

```python
tree = page.contexts.get_tree()
print(len(tree.contexts))

first = tree.contexts[0]
print(first.context)
print(first.url)
```

---

## 10. Browser-Level Capabilities

High-level entry: `page.browser_tools`

```python
user_context = page.browser_tools.create_user_context()
contexts = page.browser_tools.get_user_contexts()
page.browser_tools.remove_user_context(user_context)

windows = page.browser_tools.get_client_windows()
page.browser_tools.set_window_state(windows[0]["clientWindow"], state="maximized")
```

Suitable for:

- user context management
- client window management

### Typical usage

```python
ctx = page.browser_tools.create_user_context()
tab_id = page.browser_tools.create_tab(user_context=ctx)
page.contexts.close(tab_id)
page.browser_tools.remove_user_context(ctx)
```

---

## 11. Script Capabilities

### Get realms

```python
realms = page.get_realms()
for realm in realms:
    print(realm.type, realm.context)
```

### Execute script and get a handle

```python
result = page.eval_handle("({a: 1, b: 2})")
print(result.success)
print(result.result.handle)

page.disown_handles([result.result.handle])
```

This flow is suitable when:

- you need a handle to a remote JS object
- you want to release the handle manually after using it

### Preload script

```python
preload = page.add_preload_script("""
() => {
    window.__ready = 'ok';
}
""")

page.get("https://www.example.com")
print(page.run_js("return window.__ready"))

page.remove_preload_script(preload)
```

Suitable for:

- injecting initialization logic before page scripts execute
- attaching hooks, markers, or helper functions before the page starts running

---

## 12. Prompts

High-level entry:

- `page.wait_prompt()`
- `page.accept_prompt()`
- `page.dismiss_prompt()`
- `page.input_prompt(text)`
- `page.set_prompt_handler(...)`
- `page.clear_prompt_handler()`

### Typical patterns

#### Wait first, then handle manually

```python
page.run_js("alert('hello')", as_expr=False)
prompt = page.wait_prompt(timeout=3)
page.accept_prompt()
```

#### Handle a prompt automatically

```python
page.set_prompt_handler(prompt="ignore", prompt_text="张三")
page.run_js("prompt('请输入姓名')", as_expr=False)
page.clear_prompt_handler()
```

```python
page.set_prompt_handler(prompt="ignore", prompt_text="张三")
page.run_js("prompt('请输入姓名')", as_expr=False)
page.clear_prompt_handler()
```

---

## 13. Emulation

High-level entry: `page.emulation`

```python
page.emulation.set_network_offline(True)
page.emulation.set_javascript_enabled(False)
page.emulation.set_scrollbar_type("overlay")
page.emulation.apply_mobile_preset(
    width=390,
    height=844,
    device_pixel_ratio=3,
    user_agent="...",
)
```

Notes:

- some emulation commands may not yet be implemented in the current Firefox version
- examples in this project distinguish between “success” and “unsupported”

### Typical usage

```python
page.emulation.apply_mobile_preset(
    width=390,
    height=844,
    device_pixel_ratio=3,
    user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 ...",
)
```

---

## 14. WebExtension

High-level entry: `page.extensions`

```python
ext_id = page.extensions.install_dir(r"D:\my_extension")
page.extensions.uninstall(ext_id)
```

Suitable for:

- verifying whether a content script is active
- testing unpacked extension and xpi installation flows

---

## Protocol Source

The core capabilities of `ruyiPage` are aligned with and based on:

- WebDriver BiDi: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/

This is also the design source for many high-level APIs in this project, such as:

- `browsingContext.*`
- `network.*`
- `script.*`
- `input.*`
- `browser.*`
- `emulation.*`

## Final Notes

The core direction of `ruyiPage` is not to expose every low-level BiDi command in raw form, but to provide:

- a Firefox automation experience that feels friendly enough
- an interface that is intuitive enough for beginners
- structure that works well with editor navigation
- enough room for advanced users to access BiDi capabilities when needed

If you mainly use **Firefox** for automation, want to avoid the CDP detection surface as much as possible, and also want APIs that are easier to understand than writing raw protocol code directly, `ruyiPage` is built for that path.
